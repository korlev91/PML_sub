<p>The predictor was built in following stages.</p>
<p>1. Data filtering</p>
<p>There were several features in the training set which had NA values, empty values or #DIV/0!.<br />All values were coverted to NA (for is.na check). If mean of is.na result for any feature exceeded 0.10 (approx. &gt;10% values NA)<br />such features were discarded.</p>
<p>I also checked for low variance features but not many features has near zero variance so that condition was not used.</p>
<p>First 7 colums do not contain data which could be significant for training. Data like name, timestamps, time window etc. were removed.</p>
<p><br />2. Training on sliced data -- for primary test on training set</p>
<p>Data was partitioned into 70% training samples and 30% testing samples.</p>
<p>For validation, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold non-repetitive CV was tried. For training, I used Random Forest method. <br />The model gave overall Accuracy value of 0.993 with 5-fold CV. So, I went with that.</p>
